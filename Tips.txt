Take letterbox subs over the widescreen versions as they're easier to OCR

If the d2v file has problems (DgIndex creates d2v.bad and fix.txt files) you might have to set the order of TFM and TDeint by hand in the avs file.

If the NeroAacEncode fails, try a constant bitrate encode.

If the ac3 file is too big, and takes way too long to convert to aac, you can run DgIndex.exe standalone and extract a Wav file from the mpg encoded file 
(even doing normalization at the same time). The problem is that some of the video has no audio. You'll probably need to offset the audio when you mux
the video with it.
